At the beginning of the medieval era, Brittany was divided between three kingdoms, [Domnonea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domnon%C3%A9e "Domnonée"), [Cornouaille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornouaille "Cornouaille") and [Broërec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bro%C3%ABrec "Broërec"). These realms eventually merged into a single state during the 9th century.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference">[<span>[</span>20<span>]</span>](#cite_note-23)</sup> <sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_24-0" class="reference">[<span>[</span>21<span>]</span>](#cite_note-autogenerated1-24)</sup> The unification of Brittany was carried out by [Nominoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominoe "Nominoe"), king between 845 and 851 and considered as the Breton _[pater patriae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pater_Patriae "Pater Patriae")_. His son [Erispoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erispoe "Erispoe") secured the independence of the new kingdom of Brittany and won the [Battle of Jengland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jengland "Battle of Jengland") against [Charles the Bald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_the_Bald "Charles the Bald"). The Bretons won another war in 867, and the kingdom reached then its maximum extent: it received parts of [Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy "Normandy"), [Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_(province_of_France) "Maine (province of France)") and [Anjou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjou "Anjou") and the [Channel Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands "Channel Islands").
