Brittany has been inhabited by humans since the [Lower Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Paleolithic "Lower Paleolithic"). The first settlers were [Neanderthals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal "Neanderthal"). This population was scarce and very similar to the other Neanderthals found in the whole of Western Europe. Their only original feature was a distinct culture, called "Colombanian".<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">[<span>[</span>12<span>]</span>](#cite_note-12)</sup> One of the oldest [hearths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearth "Hearth") in the world has been found in [Plouhinec, Finistère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plouhinec,_Finist%C3%A8re "Plouhinec, Finistère"). It is 450,000 years old.

Neolithic Brittany is characterised by an important [megalithic production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalithic_architectural_elements "Megalithic architectural elements"), and it is sometimes designated as the "core area" of megalithic culture.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">[<span>[</span>13<span>]</span>](#cite_note-13)</sup> The oldest monuments, [cairns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairn "Cairn"), were followed by princely tombs and [stone rows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_row "Stone row"). The [Morbihan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbihan "Morbihan") _[département](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9partement "Département")_, on the southern coast, comprises a large share of these structures, including the [Carnac stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnac_stones "Carnac stones") and the Broken Menhir of Er Grah in [Locmariaquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locmariaquer_megaliths "Locmariaquer megaliths"), the largest single stone erected by Neolithic man.
